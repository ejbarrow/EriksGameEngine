Welcome to my game engine. To compile the engine you need to create a visual studio (2010) project.
You need to make sure you add all the necessary fies. 

Header Files to Add to Header Files Folder :-
110ct.h
ebarrow.h
game_pacman.h
game_snake.h
games.h


Source Files to Add to the Source Files Foder :-
110ct.cpp
ebarrow.cpp
game_pacman.cpp
game_snake.cpp
games.cpp
main.cpp



Please be sure to make sure all included files are in the projects folder (folder with .h and .cpp files).
These files provide user information, high scores and maps. Without these files you wont have any fun as you will have no maps!

Feel free to read map creation Readme files and have a go at creating your own. I suggest looking at current maps to see how they
look before creating your own.
