Maps are 80 characters wide and 40 characters high. To create walls you must use the "#" key. 
At the end of the map you create you can assign the starting positions for pacman and the ghosts.

The Snake always starts its heading to the left. And starts at y position 20, x position 38-41;Snake starts at 4 long. 
When creating maps be sure to make sure you do not put walls where snake spawns nor to put walls immediatly to the left of
where snake spawns.


Portals!! You can create portals at the top,bottom,left and right sides of the scrren, and the snake will appear on the other side. 
otherwise there must be a walled border on the map. if you put a portal in be sure to put the corresponding portal on 
the other side of the map.


In the map area you must have spaces (" ") to represent blank space, or the controller will not read it.
Once your map is created save it as .map & then open smaps.dat and add your map to the list.
